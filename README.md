                                                   problem A
                                                 -------------
input elements based on the input requirements
Calculating Maximum Frequency & Update m to keep track of the highest count of any single element.
Calculate removals as n - m, which gives the number of elements to be removed for uniqueness
Print the number of elements to remove to achieve unique values.

                                                   problem B
                                                --------------
sum of all brothers' numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
two brothers who arrived on time are given as `a` and `b`
therefor print `6 - (a + b)`

                                                  problem C
                                              ----------------
calculate `total rating` = sum(a) //sum of all sum += array[i]
print total rating - 2 * (second highest rating) where second-highest rating = second-largest element in the sorted array.

                                                 problem D
                                              --------------
Parse the input to get the array and the number of strings to check.
For each string, ensure it has the same length as the array.
Use two maps to establish a one-to-one correspondence between array elements and string characters.
Check for conflicts in mappings; if conflicts exist, print "NO"; otherwise, print "YES".
